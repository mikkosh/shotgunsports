Shotgun Sports app for Garmin ConnectIQ

Shotgun Sports is an app for tracking Skeet, Trap and other shotgun sports activities. It currently supports free training, Trap, Skeet, American Skeet, Nordic Trap and Hunting skeet (a Finnish skeet variant with no doubles).

Usage:
1. Select the sport variant  (Trap, Skeet etc.) from the menu
2. Add hits and misses (up and down, select to switch between the hits/misses) for each turn. If the selected sport is other than free training the total number of shots is known, so the user only needs to add hits as the misses are calculated automatically.
3. Mark the turn as finished with lap key
4. Once the round is finished the app suggests the user to save or discard the data automatically or in the case of free training the round can be finished with the menu key
5. The results can be viewed in the app or in the activity saved to Garmin Connect
